## REFACTOR PLAN:

- Break down feature into pseudocode components (functions, objects). 
- Analyze complexity, comment density, abstraction, TDD, and communicability to users. 
- Go through refactor actions tactics:
	- Introduce comments for all unclear code snippets
	- Remove duplicated code.
	- Break long methods into smaller, easier ones
	- Improve class architecture/structure
	- Improve naming
	- Optimize code/structure utilization
	- Write tests for feature restructuring
