# Maker Snake: Deep Learning Edition!

Welcome to Maker Snake! 

In this game simulation, you can see my deep reinforcement learning bot learn how to play Snake in real-time, given no user-driven gameplay. 

It simply learns parametrically based on successful and unsuccessful gameplay attempts!

If you want to see the simulation in action, feel free to clone this repo, navigate to this Snake subdirectory, and run `python3 main.py` with all relevant dependencies installed and instantiated!
